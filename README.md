### 💖 My First Project Journey
Before React, Firebase and full-stack apps, there was my very first project:

#### 🍽️ [zomato2](https://github.com/dimple-18/zomato2)
A Zomato-inspired landing page built with **pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.

- Every line of code is written by me from scratch  
- All the layout and design decisions came from my own thinking  
- This project taught me the basics of structure, spacing, typography and responsiveness  
- I keep it as a reminder of **where my developer journey started** ✨  

It’s not “perfect” — and that’s exactly why it’s special.
